Nets is an application where the user will be able to find the closest court to your home and all the infrastructure it offers such as toilet, water and parking.

# My plan / approach
-User able to Sign up, Login and Logout.
-Connect to Bing Maps API
-After Login, user can add the location, pin the court in the map and add details about infrastructure and type of court.
Pages: Sign up, Login, Logout, Add Courts and View Courts.

## Cool tech that I used
